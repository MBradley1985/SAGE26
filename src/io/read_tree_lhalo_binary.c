/*
 * read_tree_lhalo_binary.c -- reader for the lhalo-binary merger-tree format.
 *
 * The lhalo-binary format stores one or more forests per file, written
 * sequentially in a packed on-disk layout. Each file begins with a small
 * header (totnforests, totnhalos, then an array of nhalos per forest),
 * followed by the halo records -- one fixed-size `struct halo_data` per
 * halo, written tree-major. Within each tree, halos are ordered such that
 * Descendant / FirstProgenitor / NextProgenitor / FirstHaloInFOFgroup
 * indices into the record array form a self-consistent merger tree.
 *
 * This file implements the three-call lifecycle that core_io_tree.c uses:
 *   1. setup_forests_io_lht_binary()  -- at startup, read every file's
 *      header, compute the total forest count, and assign forests to
 *      this MPI task using the parameter file's ForestDistributionScheme.
 *      Open each file once and keep it open for the duration of the run.
 *   2. load_forest_lht_binary()       -- during the main loop, called once
 *      per forest assigned to this task. Allocates a halo buffer and
 *      reads the forest's halos at the precomputed byte offset.
 *   3. cleanup_forests_io_lht_binary() -- at shutdown, free per-forest
 *      bookkeeping arrays and close the open file descriptors.
 *
 * The on-disk widths matter: nhalos-per-forest is stored as 32-bit ints
 * in the file but we promote to int64_t in memory (load_tree_table_lht_binary
 * does the per-file read-and-promote dance).

/*
 * setup_forests_io_lht_binary -- per-process startup for the lhalo-binary reader.
 *
 * Called once per MPI task at startup. Walks every tree file in
 * [FirstFile, LastFile], reads its header to learn how many forests and halos
 * it contains, then assigns forests to this task using the parameter file's
 * ForestDistributionScheme. Opens each file containing this task's forests
 * once and stores the file descriptor for use by load_forest_lht_binary().
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *   1. Read each file's two-int header (totnforests, totnhalos) to learn the
 *      total forest count across all files.
 *   2. If the distribution scheme is anything other than uniform_in_forests,
 *      read every file's nhalos-per-forest array so the forest-to-task
 *      assignment can weight by forest size (some forests are 10x larger
 *      than others -- purely uniform assignment leaves tasks load-imbalanced).
 *   3. Call distribute_weighted_forests_over_ntasks() to compute this task's
 *      [start_forestnum, end_forestnum) range.
 *   4. Convert the global forest range into per-file information: which files
 *      this task touches, and where in each file the task's forests live.
 *   5. For each touched file: open it (keep it open for the run), read its
 *      nhalos-per-forest array, and compute the byte offset into the halo
 *      record stream for each of this task's forests.
 *   6. Compute frac_volume_processed -- the fraction of total simulation
 *      volume this task is responsible for. Each file is assumed to span
 *      the same volume; task-volume = sum over files of (this task's
 *      forests in file / total forests in file) / (number of files).
 *
 * On-disk header layout:
 *     bytes  0..3   int32  totnforests
 *     bytes  4..7   int32  totnhalos
 *     bytes  8..   int32  nhalos_per_forest[totnforests]
 *     after that:   packed halo records, struct halo_data, tree-major.
 *
 * Side effects:
 *   Mutates forests_info: fills in totnforests, totnhalos, nforests_this_task,
 *   FileNr (per forest), original_treenr (per forest), frac_volume_processed,
 *   and the lht sub-struct (fd-per-forest, byte offset per forest, open file
 *   descriptors, nhalos per forest). Also sets run_params->FileNr_Mulfac and
 *   run_params->ForestNr_Mulfac, used downstream to compose unique GalaxyIndex
 *   values across all files, trees, and tasks.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   EXIT_SUCCESS, or a negative error code (MALLOC_FAILURE, FILE_NOT_FOUND,
 *   or whatever distribute_weighted_forests_over_ntasks / find_start_and_end_filenum
 *   returned).

 * nhalos-per-forest array (located at byte offset 8, after the two 4-byte
 * header ints) and writes the values into the caller's output buffer.
 *
 * Width-conversion note:
 *   On disk these are 32-bit integers (the LHT format predates the need
 *   for >2^31 halos per forest). In memory we use int64_t for consistency
 *   with the rest of the pipeline. We read each file's 32-bit values into
 *   a temporary buffer, then widen-and-copy into the int64_t output array.
 *   The temp buffer is sized once to the largest file's forest count to
 *   avoid per-file malloc/free.
 *
 * Inputs:
 *   firstfile, lastfile   -- inclusive file-number range to read.
 *   totnforests_per_file  -- number of forests in each file (already read
 *                           by Step 1 of setup_forests_io_lht_binary()).
 *   run_params            -- used by get_forests_filename_lht_binary().
 *   ThisTask              -- MPI rank, used only for the warning on empty
 *                           first files (printed by rank 0 only).
 *   nhalos_per_forest     -- output buffer; must be sized to totnforests.
 *                           Filled in file-order, contiguously.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   EXIT_SUCCESS on success, FILE_NOT_FOUND if a tree file is missing,
 *   or -1 on inconsistent counts.
